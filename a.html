 Carla has been quilting for ten years. She does this when she finds free time. She finds much satisfaction creating her 
 own works of art; Quilting always relaxes her. She is very talented and is enthusiatic about sharing her techniqes. She 
 takes pride in her works and always enjoys seeing her finished products, though most of all sharing them with everyone.

 Carla's Quilts:<br>
 
 A quilt is a multi-layered textile, traditionally composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of 
 batting or wadding, and a woven back, combined using the technique of quilting, the process of sewing the three layers 
 together. Occasionally, the three layers of the quilt are tied together using evenly spaced knots rather than sewn. 
 This unique process of binding three layers of fiber together distinguishes quilts from other types of blankets, 
 although in modern British English, an unquilted duvet or comforter may also be called a "quilt." Historically, 
 quilts were frequently used as bedcovers; this use persists today, but in the twenty-first century, quilts are 
 also frequently displayed as non-utilitarian works of art.<br>However, the work involved in creating them and 
 their decorative possibilities has led to their cultural importance in many places and times, and they are 
 increasingly also treasured as a visual art form.
