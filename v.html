<h1>Welcome Vendors</h1>
        			
        <p> 
            Hello again, it's Bernie here. I want to thank each one of you for showing interest in Gift Shop Stop's retail web site. All vendors who are going to sell their merchandise on our site are encouraged to e-mail me with their digital pictures, names of items, least price amount wanted for each item to be sold and detailed information about each item as soon as possible for marketing, web designing and advertising purposes.</p><p> I will design a home page for each vendor to each ones own personnal liking via contact, via email or via phone. (If I don't hear from you after getting your sales information, I will design your own home page to my own specifications). Each vendor will have their own drop down link on the home page under the upcoming new "Products" link (Which is now called "Quilts"), and will be given a link with your own name (such as Carla's Quilts does). I will need any name or business name that you prefer to use. All individual home pages may be easilly linked to any other web site or social media site via link. Each vendor must e-mail me to get updated information about money transfers (transfers may be done on a case per case basis, though preferably threw PayPal, it's simple and easy to set up an account and easy to use). You may sell as many items as you want at any given time. After your items are sold, and after you receive payment, you will ship the items to the buyers, then I will remove the items sold from your own home page, and put it in your own portfolio gallery page for advertising purposes. At request each vendor will be provided with their own @giftshopstop.com email address, such as johndoe@giftshopstop.com.</p>
           
           <p> If you are interested in me updating, upgrading or maintaining any current web-sites that you own, or if you are interested in having me designing and developing a new individual web-site; contact me with prior contact information given, or contact me on the contact form on the contact page or e-mail me at Support@giftshopstop.com</p>
         <p> 
             I am looking forward in beginning this collaberation with each one of you. Take good close up digital pictures of merchadise with a one color background (light shaded or white). Remember the better the pictures, the better the sales. Have fun with it, and I hope to hear from each one of you as soon as possible.</p>
